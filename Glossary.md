# Glossary

**Population:** The collection of all items of interest to our study; denoted N.

**Sample:** A subset of the population; denoted n.

**Parameter:** Is a value that refers to a population. It is the opposite of statistic.

**Statistic:** Is a value that refers to a sample. It is opposite of statistic.

**Random Sample:** A random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance.

----

**representative sample:** A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.

**variable:** A variable is a set of characteristics of a person, object, thing, idea, etc. Variables can vary from case to case. For example, 'height' is a variable that describes a characteristic of a person. It varies from person to person.

**types of data:**	A way to classify data. There are two types of data - categorical and numerical. 

**categorical data:**	A subset of types of data. Describes categories or groups.

**numerical data:**	A subset of types of data. Represents numbers. Can be further divided into discrete and continuous.
discrete data	Data that can be counted in a finite matter. Opposite of continuous.

**continuous data:**	Data that is 'infinite' and impossible to count. Opposite of discrete. 

**levels of measurement:**	A way to classify data. There are two levels of measurement - qualitative and quantitative, which are further divided into nominal & ordinal, and ratio & interval, respectively. 

**qualitative data:**	A subset of levels of measurement. There are two types of qualitative data - nominal and ordinal.

**quantitative data:**	A subset of levels of measurement. There are two types of quantitative data - ratio and interval.
nominal	Refers to variables that describe different categories and cannot be put in any order.

**ordinal:**	Refers to variables that describe different categories, but can be ordered.

**ratio:**	A number, no matter if whole or a fraction. There exists a unique and unambiguous zero point. 

*interval:**	An interval variable represents a number or an interval. There isn't a unique and unambiguous zero point. For example, degrees in Celsius and Fahrenheit are interval variables, while Kelvin is a ratio variable.
