# Glossary

**Population:** The collection of all items of interest to our study; denoted N.

**Sample:** A subset of the population; denoted n.

**Parameter:** Is a value that refers to a population. It is the opposite of statistic.

**Statistic:** Is a value that refers to a sample. It is opposite of statistic.

**Random Sample:** A random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance.

----

**Representative sample:** A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.

**Variable:** A variable is a set of characteristics of a person, object, thing, idea, etc. Variables can vary from case to case. For example, 'height' is a variable that describes a characteristic of a person. It varies from person to person.

**Types of data:**	A way to classify data. There are two types of data - categorical and numerical. 

**Categorical data:**	A subset of types of data. Describes categories or groups.

**Numerical data:**	A subset of types of data. Represents numbers. Can be further divided into discrete and continuous.
discrete data	Data that can be counted in a finite matter. Opposite of continuous.

**Continuous data:**	Data that is 'infinite' and impossible to count. Opposite of discrete. 

**Levels of measurement:**	A way to classify data. There are two levels of measurement - qualitative and quantitative, which are further divided into nominal & ordinal, and ratio & interval, respectively. 

**Qualitative data:**	A subset of levels of measurement. There are two types of qualitative data - nominal and ordinal.

**Quantitative data:**	A subset of levels of measurement. There are two types of quantitative data - ratio and interval.
nominal	Refers to variables that describe different categories and cannot be put in any order.

**Ordinal:**	Refers to variables that describe different categories, but can be ordered.

**Ratio:**	A number, no matter if whole or a fraction. There exists a unique and unambiguous zero point. 

**Interval:**	An interval variable represents a number or an interval. There isn't a unique and unambiguous zero point. For example, degrees in Celsius and Fahrenheit are interval variables, while Kelvin is a ratio variable.

**Frequency distribution table:**	A table that represents the frequency of each variable.

**Frequency:**	Measures the occurrence of a variable.
absolute frequency	Measures the NUMBER of occurrences of a variable.

**Relative frequency:**	Measures the RELATIVE NUMBER of occurrences of a variable. Usually, expressed in percentages. 

**Cumulative frequency:**	The sum of relative frequencies so far. The cumulative frequency of all members is 100% or 1. 
Pareto diagram	A special type of bar chart, where frequencies are shown in descending order. There is an additional line on the chart, showing the cumulative frequency.

**Histogram:**	A type of bar chart that represents numerical data. It is divided into intervals (or bins) that are not overlapping and span from the first observation to the last. The intervals (bins) are adjacent - where one stops, the other starts.
